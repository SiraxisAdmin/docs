## Getting started with SlyceIO

Welcome to the SlyceIO quickstart guide. Follow the instructions below to get up and running in 3 easy steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Creating an account only requires a valid email address. A time dependent security code will be sent to your email address which can then be used to log in to the UI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your containers">    
    Create [connections](concepts/connections), [container definitions](concepts/containerdefinitions), and [query definitions](concepts/querydefinitions). Secure container definition access with [API keys](concepts/apikeys).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access your container data">
    Container data is accessed using the SlyceIO data gateway. The [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) contains a comprehensive set of instructions and interactive code for communicating with the gateway.
