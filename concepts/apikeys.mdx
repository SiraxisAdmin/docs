## Overview

An API key details the exchange information, access token duration, container permissions and the physical key that is used for authentication. 

Use the [authentication token endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/authentication) to issue an encrypted bearer token for the required API key, which can then be used to access container data via the [document endpoints](/api-reference/endpoint/create).

<Tip>
<b>API key exchange</b> allows you to easily schedule access - you don't need to worry about issuing keys at the exact date and time.

## API Key Fields
<Steps>
  <Step title="API Key">
	The physical key that is exchanged for an encrypted bearer token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Key Exchange Allowed">
	When checked, the API key can be exchanged for a token, otherwise exchange is denied.
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Key Exchange Allowed From/To (UTC)">
    The API key can only be exchanged within these dates, any attempt to exchange an API key outside of these dates will be refused.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Token Duration">
    This defines the token lifetime in minutes. Once the token has expired then the API key will need to be exchanged for a new token. For increased security we recommend the duration is kept as small as possible to prevent misuse.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Permissions">
   Permissions allows you to secure one or more container definitions against one or more CRUD or query operations for a specific API key. Any attempt to access a container definition without the necessary permissions will result in an unauthorized response.
  </Step>
</Steps>
