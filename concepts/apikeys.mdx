## Overview

An API key details the exchange information, access token duration and container permissions. 

They are exchanged via the [authentication token endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/authentication) for encrypted bearer tokens which can then be used to access container data through the [document endpoints](/api-reference/endpoint/create).

<Tip>
<b>API key exchange</b> allows you to easily schedule access - you don't need to worry about issuing keys at that exact moment and time.
</Tip>

## Context Menu
You can use the context menu to **edit** or **delete** existing API keys definitions or **assign** container permissions.
