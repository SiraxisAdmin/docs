## Using Query Definitions

Query Definitions allow you to define multiple queries for the selected container definition using Azure Cosmos DB SQL. 

Static and parameterized queries are both available.
```
 select * from c 
 where c.id = @{{MyIdParameter}} 
 and c.category = '@{{MyCategoryParameter}}'
 and c.version = 1`
```

<Tip>
Queries can be tested to ensure their function is correct before being made available through the API.
</Tip>

## Context Menu
Once created you can use the context menu to view, edit or delete existing query definitions.
