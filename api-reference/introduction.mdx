## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

In order to access the document endpoints you must:
<ul>
<li>Create an API key within the SlyceIO UI</li> 
<li>Retrieve a time dependant encrypted bearer token via the <b>authentication endpoint</b></li> 
</ul>


```json
"security": [
  {
    "ApiKeyAuth": []
  }
]
```

<Note>
Bearer token security is used for all <b>Document Endpoints</b>.
</Note>
```json
"security": [
  {
    "BearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
